# Ford GoBike System Data Analysis
## by Francis Wesa Wobulu


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

The data has the following features and includes:
- Trip Duration (seconds)
- Start Time and Date
- End Time and Date
- Start Station ID
- Start Station Name
- Start Station Latitude
- Start Station Longitude
- End Station ID
- End Station Name
- End Station Latitude
- End Station Longitude
- Bike ID
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
- Member Birth Year
- Member Gender
- Bike share for all Trip

## Summary of Findings

- There are only two types of bike users put into two categgories:-
  - Customer
  - Subscriber
- Subscribers were the onces who took more rides.

- Most trips were taken between Monday and Friday with Thursday having the highest number of trips taken while Sunday and Sartuday recorded a low number of trips.

- There is peak bike rides between 8 and 9 in the morning and between 5 and 6 in the evening.
Most of the Bike Trips were taken by Males

- There are 329 start stations and MarketSt at 10th st has the higest number of trips being taken while 16th St Depot station has the fewest trips started from that location.

- There are aslo 329 end stations and San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St) is the station where most people end there trips while 21st Ave at International Blvd is the station with the least amount of trips ended there.

- Its seems that the average duration rides vary very slighlty by age-roup, with young riders and and middle age having a low while seniors have a higher average, this makes sense since younger riders are generally more energetic, hence are able to ride their bikes faster.

- During early mornings and late at night most of the Bike riders are male.

- Customers travel for longer durations regardless of the day of the week as compared to subscribers.




## Key Insights for Presentation
- For the presentation, I focus on the distribution of rides per hour, day, and user type, and their gender. and how these features affect one another.
- The number of bike riders who are subscribers is consistently higher than that of customers throughout the week.
- The distribution of the hours column is roughly bimodal with 2 peaks. The fist peak is at 8am and the other at 5pm. These 2 peaks indicate the times when most bike rides start.
- Male bike riders are high in number followed by female bike riders and those who did not indicate their gender.
